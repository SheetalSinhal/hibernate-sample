For customized primary key generator, steps are:

i) Create entity class with default constructor and getter and setters for fields.
ii) Create hibernate configuration file.
iii) Create test application.
iv) Create class that generate custom primary key for the record.
      Class extends IdentityGenerator class and override generate() method.
      generate() methods contains logic that creates custom primary key.
      
 For Reference:
 
 Account class (entity), AccountNumberGenerator class(custom primary key generator class), resources/account-db-mapping.hbm.xml (mapping file) and autoGeneratePrimaryKey_Customized() method in App class
 
 Note: If getting error while execution create account table, create table by yourself in database.
 Note: For sample used concept of Sequence in database.
